# DEX project from Moralis.

This project involves ERC20 smart contracts, a token, a wallet and a DEX contract. This project is in React framework, with Hardhat and Ethers js. I started a year ago when I was finishing the Ethereum 201 course with Filip from Moralis. It took me about a year to first learn more by taking the Crypto Kitties course with Truffle, web3 and Ganache. Then, I took the React course with Zsolt Nagy and built an exchange with React. Then I did some more learning on my own and finally came back to develop the front-end for the smart contract DEX, using EThers js and Hardhat. 
I've learned a lot and hope I keep on making progress and eventually work as a blockchain developer, very soon.


# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
